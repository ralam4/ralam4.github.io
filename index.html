								<h2>Our 5W1H:
								</h2>
								<p><strong><u><em>Who:</em></u></strong>
									The Project 5W1H was born out of an idea from founder rafee a, who wanted to do more with his photography hobby and the conversations he had with people.
									He realized that many people felt comfortable talking to him by easily sharing their personal problems, venting, or just chit chatting— even if he barely knew the person.
									After getting a iphone 7 plus, rafee’s newly developed photography hobby grew (he loved being people’s personal photographer). However, he felt no satisfaction by just taking cool portrait mode pictures on his phone and posting them on Instagram.
									He thought of a way to create something out of his conversations and the pictures of people.
									By combining these two situations, rafee created the concept behind Project 5W1H. Now that the project has rolled out, rafee realized that with the little time he has as an engineering student he would need help in order to create material of high quality for people— cue akshara m (AK).
									AK and rafee are friends who met their freshman year in college. They were in an engineering group project that aimed to solve the world’s problems through engineering.
									Knowing that AK was a hard worker and after seeing her passion for the movement, rafee asked her to join the project. 
									</br>
								 </p>
								<p><strong><u><em>What:</em></u></strong>
										Every story has a who, what, when, where, why & how-- these are the 5W's and 1H that our project answers.
										Goal 1 is for Project 5W1H to be a tool to fight the negative stereotypes and voices in our heads by showcasing people's backgrounds and futures—stories that may be similar & relatable to your situations.
										Goal 2 is for Project 5W1H to help older generations understand and reconnect with the millennial generation... to show them that they were once in our steps and situations, felt the same emotions, and chased the dreams we have.
										Goal 3 is for Project 5W1H to motivate and show younger generations that they are not alone. Our stories may encourage younger generations to follow their passions.
										Through Project 5W1H, we hope to create a social movement among our generation (& other generations) — a movement that inspires us to learn about ourselves and others, one conversation at a time.
 								   </br>
								  </p>
								<p><strong><u><em>When:</em></u></strong>
										We started the movement in early 2017 and are working hard to bring more quality content out throughout the year. 
									 </br>
								  </p>
								<p><strong><u><em>Where:</em></u></strong>
										Our stories (so far) are based in Arizona but each story begins and continues in cities & countries around the world.
									 </br>
								  </p>
								<p><strong><u><em>Why:</em></u></strong>
										In high school, rafee had a history teacher named Mr. Tribby. The high school had about 2000 students that went there.
										So one of Mr. Tribby’s lectures was about how it was easy to get lost in the crowd and feel irrelevant in the mix of everyone.
										He asked what are you going to do to make you stand out from that crowd? Since then, rafee has been forever inspired to do something to stand out from that crowd, yet realized that everyone stands out in the crowd.
										Everyone has a special story or something they are fighting. That is the idea we would like to address and showcase with Project 5W1H.
									 </br>
								  </p>
								<p><strong><u><em>How:</em></u></strong>
										Pictures. Conversations. Instagram. You. Photography allows us to capture people and their 5W1H.
										Our brain remembers an image better than it can remember a name. We relate to pictures and often create our own story in response to that picture.
										Social media lets us connect one’s 5W1H to a picture and share the real story behind an image.
										Project 5W1H is a movement for people to begin having a dialogue/conversation.
										We often feel so isolated and alone in the world because we rarely share our stories with each other.
										But this can change. You can start having conversations with people you've known for weeks/months/years by simply trying to learn their 5W1H.
										You can meet someone for the first time and with the understanding that everyone has a 5W1H, you may be less judgmental, prejudiced, and more open.
