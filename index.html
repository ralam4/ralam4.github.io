								<h2>Our 5W1H:
								</h2>
								<p><strong><u><em>Who:</em></u></strong> The Project 5W1H is an idea that came from founder rafee a, who wanted to do more with his instagram pictures. He realized that many people like to talk to him-- often just randomly venting --even if he barely knew the person.
									 Also ever since he got his iphone 7 plus, he pretends to be a photographer. By combining the two situations, rafee created the idea of a 5W1H with the purpose to serve people that felt lost or disconnected with the world.
									 Now that the project has rolled out, rafee realized that with the little time he has as an engineering student some help would be needed in order to bring a good quality of work to people-- queue akshara m.
									 Akshara (AK) and rafee are friends who met their freshman year in college. They were in an engineering group project that aimed to solve the worlds problems through engineering. Rafee asked AK to join the team because he knew she was a hard worker and expressed
									 a passion for the movement when he told her about it. </br> </p>
									<p><strong><u><em>What:</em></u></strong> Every story has a who, what, when, where, why & how-- those are the 5W's and 1H.
										Goal 1 is for Project 5W1H to be a tool to fight the negative voices in our heads by showcasing people's backgrounds and futures that can be similar & relatable to your situations.
										Goal 2 is for Project 5W1H to help older generations understand and reconnect with the millenial generation... to have them recollect that they were once in our steps and situations --often feeling the same emotions and having the same dreams we did.
										Project 5W1H's hopes are to be a social movement among our generation, that people can use in their conversations with the people they know the most and the least.
 								  </br> </p>
									<p><strong><u><em>When:</em></u></strong>
										We have started the movement in 2017 and are working hard to bring more quality content out throughout the year. </br> </p>
									<p><strong><u><em>Where:</em></u></strong>
										Arizona </br></p>
									<p><strong><u><em>Why:</em></u></strong>
										In high school, rafee had a history teacher named Mr. Tribby. One of the lectures he gave told us it was easy to get lost in the crowd. Do something that makes you stand out of the crowd. </br></p>
									<p><strong><u><em>How: </em></u></strong>
									  Pictures. Instagram. You. Photography allows us to capture the people and individuals infront of their 5W1H.
								    When we see a picture our brain remembers that image better than it can remember a name. We relate to pictures and often create our own story's of that picture.
									  Social media allows us to connect the 5W1H to that picture and provide the real story behind an image.
									  Project 5W1H really is a movement for people to begin having a dialogue/conversation. We feel so isolated and alone in the world because we do not share our stories with each other. You can start have conversations with people you've known for weeks/months/years by trying to get their 5W1H.
									  Or you may meet someone for the first time and understanding everyone has a 5W1H, you are less judgemental and hold less prejudices.
									  This project is you. Your stories. Your voice. Your movement. </br>
