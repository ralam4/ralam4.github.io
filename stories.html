								<h3><center>Maham H</center></h3>
								<p><strong>Who: </strong></br>
								A 21 year old pre-med Muslim born and raised in Arizona? Just one side of her story. </br>
								Who is Maham H? As I ask her this question, she is hesitant to reflect on her own self. Maham is at the stage where every 20-something year old is at in their life. That stage of anxiety, nervousness, and doubt which creates a nearsightedness that clouds the clear vision of all future goals and aspirations. That stage where your future is just another link on a chain, which connects and depends on the previous link. Maham knows those feelings all too well as her story only begins as her senior year ends. But as she reflects on her past, there is no doubt Maham knows who she is as a person in this world.</p>

								<p><strong>What: </strong></br>
								What did I learn about Maham H? I learned the details of her story that make her who she is today. I got to understand her experiences from the past and how those have built Maham’s quailities and characteristics. Maham grew up with a real passion for school, so much so that as a punishment to herself would be to stay home from school. Maham’s faith is the side you may not see, but it’s a significant part of who she is today. She went to Islamic school and Qur’an class every day after school. Her spirituality has been the backbone to her life for those moments encompassed by doubt and anxiety. Her faith & spirituality is her own definition that helps her get through life. She wasn’t born with this understanding as many of us are not. Personal experiences in her past have led her to form her own beliefs and strengthen the ones already instilled in her. Maham grew up in this post 9/11 society where terrorist “jokes” were a part of school life, where one classmate hated her initially based on her faith, but those experiences have shaped her to be the strong woman who will stand up and support not only immigrants or Muslim people, but anyone who deserves a voice. What did I learn about Maham H? Humbleness. Compassion. Drive. </p>

								<p><strong>When: </strong></br>
								When does Maham H’s story begin? Maham’s story does not begin the day she was born. Her story begins the day her father stepped foot in California to work, in order to provide for his family back home and his family he would make in America. Her father gave her the drive and compassion to do whatever she wants to do in life. Coming from a small town in Pakistan, Maham’s father came to America and worked long hours in an air-traffic control tower. After work he would get old beat up cars and fix them up to sell them. Even though the H. family did not have much monetary wise, Maham’s parents never let them feel that struggle. Family is huge part to Maham. As the middle child, Maham has never had any interest in money or possessions because she had her family. Maham knows her blessings and doesn’t hesitate to thank God for the car dealership that her father now owns. Her mother gave her the humbleness and caring qualities that make Maham into the person she is today. Her mother studied to be a pharmacist in Pakistan and sacrificed her previous education to begin a new life raising her family in America. The moment her parents came to America their sacrifice allowed them to support their family by giving their children a life full of opportunities. Her parents’ selflessness and charity to their community and family are the foundation of Maham’s personality and background.
							  </p>

								<p><strong>Where: </strong></br>
								Where does Maham H’s story begin? Maham was raised in the East Valley of Arizona. From Chandler to Scottsdale to Ahwatukee, Maham is shaped by her community both American and Pakistani. Maham is part of this new group of 1st generation born immigrant children that identify with not only their parents’ culture but the American culture/environment they live in. School friends knew the side she could show, that excluded her love for old Bollywood songs. Family friends/her parents knew the side that she would give them but didn’t reveal too much. “Never “white” enough for “white” people and not “brown” enough for “brown” people.” - Maham H. Her Pakistani-American background provided her the diversity and ability to fit in with any group like a chameleon, always adjusting to her setting and adapting to her surroundings.
							  </p>

								<p><strong>Why: </strong></br>
								Why Maham H? I knew Maham. We became friends about a year and a half ago. I knew she was one of the pre-med students. I knew she volunteered at hospitals and tutored refugee children when she wasn’t studying for tests and at her research lab. We’ve talked. But before sitting down to do PROJECT x 5W1H, Maham was just part of the 70,000 people I see at ASU. Today… Maham stands out of that crowd. Her story gives a relatable feeling that connects us with each other. If you are a 15-year-old living in Trump’s “America”, look up to Maham, a strong and proud Muslim woman who has survived this far and will continue to go above and beyond. If you are a 20 something year old or older, you were Maham at one point in time in your life. We are all connected in some way.
								</p>

								<p><strong>How: </strong></br>
									I asked Maham H:
									How does sharing your story help others?
									“Never be ashamed of your culture…
									Diversity is the most important part to being open minded” - Maham H. Often when we are growing up as teenagers in today’s society we feel our parents do not understand anything because they didn’t grow up here. It’s important to realize what they gave up so that you can live a life not worrying about the things they had to experience. Talking about her parents, Maham knows that her parents sacrifice is the only reason why she can chase her goals. No matter how much we reject our parents, we are direct reflections of their character.
									The best part of PROJECT x 5W1H is that I had a 2 hour long real conversation with Maham. We talked about each other’s lives, our parents, our background and our goals. A 2 hour real conversation. I wish I could write everything. This is Maham. Maham is our generation.
