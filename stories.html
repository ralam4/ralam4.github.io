								<h3><center>Maham H</center></h3>

							<a name="mahamtop"></a>
								<p><strong>Who: </strong></br>
								A 21 year old pre-med Muslim born and raised in Arizona? Just one side of her story. </br>
								Who is Maham H? As I ask her this question, she is hesitant to reflect on her own self. Maham is at the stage where every 20-something year old is at in their life.
								That stage of anxiety, nervousness, and doubt which creates a nearsightedness that clouds the clear vision of all future goals and aspirations.
								That stage where your future is just another link on a chain, which connects and depends on the previous link. Maham knows those feelings all too well as her story only begins as her senior year ends.
								But as she reflects on her past, there is no doubt Maham knows who she is as a person in this world.</p>

								<p><strong>What: </strong></br>
								What did I learn about Maham H? I learned the details of her story that make her who she is today. I got to understand her experiences from the past and how those have built Maham’s quailities and characteristics.
								Maham grew up with a real passion for school, so much so that as a punishment to herself would be to stay home from school. Maham’s faith is the side you may not see, but it’s a significant part of who she is today.
								She went to Islamic school and Qur’an class every day after school. Her spirituality has been the backbone to her life for those moments encompassed by doubt and anxiety. Her faith & spirituality is her own definition that helps her get through life.
								She wasn’t born with this understanding as many of us are not. Personal experiences in her past have led her to form her own beliefs and strengthen the ones already instilled in her. Maham grew up in this post 9/11 society where terrorist “jokes” were a part of school life, where one classmate hated her initially based on her faith, but those experiences have shaped her to be the strong woman who will stand up and support not only immigrants or Muslim people, but anyone who deserves a voice.
								What did I learn about Maham H? Humbleness. Compassion. Drive. </p>

							<a name="mahammiddle"></a>
								<p><strong>When: </strong></br>
								When does Maham H’s story begin? Maham’s story does not begin the day she was born. Her story begins the day her father stepped foot in California to work, in order to provide for his family back home and his family he would make in America.
								Her father gave her the drive and compassion to do whatever she wants to do in life. Coming from a small town in Pakistan, Maham’s father came to America and worked long hours in an air-traffic control tower.
								After work he would get old beat up cars and fix them up to sell them. Even though the H. family did not have much monetary wise, Maham’s parents never let them feel that struggle.
								Family is huge part to Maham. As the middle child, Maham has never had any interest in money or possessions because she had her family. Maham knows her blessings and doesn’t hesitate to thank God for the car dealership that her father now owns.
								Her mother gave her the humbleness and caring qualities that make Maham into the person she is today. Her mother studied to be a pharmacist in Pakistan and sacrificed her previous education to begin a new life raising her family in America.
								The moment her parents came to America their sacrifice allowed them to support their family by giving their children a life full of opportunities.
								Her parents’ selflessness and charity to their community and family are the foundation of Maham’s personality and background.
							  </p>

								<p><strong>Where: </strong></br>
								Where does Maham H’s story begin? Maham was raised in the East Valley of Arizona. From Chandler to Scottsdale to Ahwatukee, Maham is shaped by her community both American and Pakistani.
								Maham is part of this new group of 1st generation born immigrant children that identify with not only their parents’ culture but the American culture/environment they live in.
								School friends knew the side she could show, that excluded her love for old Bollywood songs. Family friends/her parents knew the side that she would give them but didn’t reveal too much.
								“Never “white” enough for “white” people and not “brown” enough for “brown” people.” - Maham H. Her Pakistani-American background provided her the diversity and ability to fit in with any group like a chameleon, always adjusting to her setting and adapting to her surroundings.
							  </p>

							<a name="mahamend"></a>
								<p><strong>Why: </strong></br>
								Why Maham H? I knew Maham. We became friends about a year and a half ago. I knew she was one of the pre-med students.
								I knew she volunteered at hospitals and tutored refugee children when she wasn’t studying for tests and at her research lab.
								We’ve talked. But before sitting down to do PROJECT 5W1H, Maham was just part of the 70,000 people I see at ASU. Today… Maham stands out of that crowd.
								Her story gives a relatable feeling that connects us with each other. If you are a 15-year-old living in Trump’s “America”, look up to Maham, a strong and proud Muslim woman who has survived this far and will continue to go above and beyond.
								If you are a 20 something year old or older, you were Maham at one point in time in your life. We are all connected in some way.
								</p>

								<p><strong>How: </strong></br>
									I asked Maham H:
									How does sharing your story help others?
									“Never be ashamed of your culture…
									Diversity is the most important part to being open minded” - Maham H. Often when we are growing up as teenagers in today’s society we feel our parents do not understand anything because they didn’t grow up here. It’s important to realize what they gave up so that you can live a life not worrying about the things they had to experience. Talking about her parents, Maham knows that her parents sacrifice is the only reason why she can chase her goals. No matter how much we reject our parents, we are direct reflections of their character.
									The best part of PROJECT 5W1H is that I had a 2 hour long real conversation with Maham. We talked about each other’s lives, our parents, our background and our goals. A 2 hour real conversation. I wish I could write everything. This is Maham. Maham is our generation.

								<h3><center>Zak M</center></h3>

							<a name="zaktop"></a>
									<p><strong>Who: </strong></br>
									Who is Zakaria M?
									Zak is a senior at ASU, looking to make a place for himself in the world as a physician and an empathetic citizen. But as we hear his 5W1H there is much more to Zak that has given him that desire to achieve his medical goals. Zak is that person you want to be around. His smile is so contagious that it is really hard not to laugh and be happy with him.
									If you were to meet Zak for the first time, I bet that you instantly want to be his friend, because there would never be a dull moment with him. But if you talk (like really have a conversation) with him, I bet you are impressed and surprised by his story. He has experienced so much in 21 years that it is difficult to fit it all in an Instagram post.
									Zak’s 5W1H is full of change. He has changed countries 3 times, he has changed languages, his family has changed--- But Zak as a person has never changed. He has adapted and grown, but his roots remain the same. He doesn’t forget his Somalian background, or his time in Egypt. His faith remains true.
									Zak sees his religion as a big factor in who he is. Not everyone his age can relate to their religion, so it’s a quality he does not take for granted. Zak is not just an older brother to his sister and youngest 8-year-old brother, but a role model. Zak’s favorite role, however was being a grandson to his grandmother.
									He tributes who he is and his personality to her. Family is a big part of Zak. And that’s precisely the feeling you get when you meet Zak… he treats you as if you are his family. Let that settle in for a second. The power of Zak’s treatment towards others. You could know Zak for years or just have been introduced and you feel like you belong. That’s who Zak is.
									</p>
									<p><strong>What: </strong></br>
									What did Zak teach me (and maybe you)?
									To his friends and family, Zak is known to be calm, caring, and optimistic. He credits his positive, uplifting attitude and warm personality to one of his strongest supporters, his loudest cheerleader if you will—his grandmother. Even when Zak was little, he remembers his grandmother’s helpful nature even while surrounded by the suffering and negativity of the Somali Civil War.
									Instead of keeping clothes and gifts Zak’s uncle in Canada sent her, she chose to gift them to neighbors who needed them. While watching his grandmother’s ever ready helpful hand and giving nature, Zak decided to do the same. To this day, Zak continues to follow his grandmother’s actions by helping, encouraging, and supporting others on their bad days as well as their good days, one smile at a time.
									Zak’s owes his strong work ethic and motivation to his mother who serves as the glue binding his family. In fear of raising her children in the violence caused by the Somali Civil War and the opportunities available in the US, Zak’s mother made the final decision to move her family from Somalia to Egypt and then Arizona and supported her family and Zak’s grandmother, mentally and physically.
									Zak’s father worked in Dubai as a businessman in order to support his family. Although Zak used to spend months away from his father, he learnt how to treat his friends with respect. His father, a master of several languages, showed Zak how to make others feel welcome and treated with equality. Zak embodies the very qualities that his family has lived by and treats others with the same compassion, respect, and diligence.
									So what did Zak teach me? To put others’ needs before yours. To listen to their situations and troubles. To give back. To be selfless.
									</p>

							<a name="zakmiddle"></a>
								<p><strong>When: </strong></br>
									Zak’s story began the day he witnessed the violence and unrest of the Somali Civil War at his doorstep. His story began the day he moved to Egypt.
									His story began again during his first day of school in Arizona. Zak’s story is a story of perseverance, change, and adaptation.
									As Zak’s story starts and continues with every move and challenge, he discovers new things about who he is and learns who he wants to be.
									When I asked Zak the question above, he shared with me the stories of his childhood. When Zak was only 6 years old, he saw a victim of the war right in front of his house, injured and bleeding from the violence of a bloody war.
									He asked his mother why this man was just laying there, injured and bleeding—her answer: they’re in a better place now.
									That positivity and comforting response to such a horrific memory plays in to who Zak is. </p>

								<p><strong>Where: </strong></br>
									Zak as a kid was very quiet and reserved--- something you would never guess if you meet him today. When he moved to Egypt from Somalia, Zak felt right at home.
									He played soccer on the streets with the other kids. There was a mosque nearby his home and every block surrounding him.
									His mom would walk him 3-4 miles a day to school. Egypt had become the place he loved as a home.
									At 9, Zak had to start all over as the shy and reserved kid- just now in Arizona. He knew some English, but was put in ESL and ELL classes for non-English speaking students. But soccer was his outlet.
									Zak could communicate with other kids through his love of the game. He became friends with the kids that he would play soccer with at recess. Soccer connected two worlds for Zak.
									His Somali/Egyptian background to his new home in Arizona. </p>

							<a name="zakend"></a>
								<p><strong>Why: </strong></br>
									21. College student. Loves and always supports his family and friends. Zak is that normal guy you may not even notice in a crowd of people.
									Just like the rest of us. But if you talk to Zak and learn about his life, you will learn that there is nothing normal about his life.
									That guy in the crowd now stands out. Zak’s large, warm smile easily makes one feel safe and comfortable but we wanted to know the why, the how, etc.
									Zak is the perfect example of how we can be part of the crowd, but unique in our own ways. The lessons he learned about accommodating, persevering, and optimism can teach/inspire us what to do as we face our struggles.
									Like many of us, Zak doesn’t really know what his future has in store for him yet. He knows he is going to try to go to medical school, but right now he’s just focused on finishing his undergraduate studies and continuing the rest of the process.
									This is a relatable feeling for any 21/22/23-year-old graduating from college or learning to live by themselves. That is the goal of Project 5W1H: showing how our own stories stand out from the crowd and connecting or relating our experiences to each other’s. </p>
								<p><strong>How: </strong></br>
									After speaking with Zak and listening to him tell me about Somalia, Egypt and growing up in America--- I thought how the heck am I supposed to relate to what Zak has gone through?! I did not grow up in country caught in an ongoing war. I never moved to a different country (let alone twice).
									I never really was close to my grandparents growing up. But that’s what a 5W1H does…it creates a connection for people who may have never gone through such experiences to be more accepting and appreciative of others. However, perhaps you feel some similarities to Zak’s story.
									You might have felt and understood his love for his grandmother, parents, and younger siblings. Maybe soccer or some other activity was your outlet when you felt your voice wasn’t heard or you were alone. By sharing your 5W1H and learning about others’ 5W1H, you will become more aware and accepting of people with new, different backgrounds.
									We all have our own unique cultures, speak different languages, and celebrate different customs.  If you first meet someone and don’t get along with them, try to have a real conversation about the who, what, when, where, why, and how to their story.
									In return, you may learn something relatable. Even if you know someone for a long time and think you know everything about them, try asking them about their 5W1H questions and you will learn something you didn’t know before.
									Regardless, the one thing Zak wants you to take away from his story is: compassion. </p>
									“In Somalia the community is a lot closer, everyone helps each other out in times of need… Now, here everyone is survival of the fittest and you’re on your own… so one message I’d give to people would be to just be nice to people… feel each other’s pain because everyone is going through something, everyone has a different battle they are fighting with so be compassionate to each other. Imagine if each one of us was really nice to each other, treated our neighbors as if they were our brother, sister, uncle or aunt… this would be a better world.”-Zak M.
